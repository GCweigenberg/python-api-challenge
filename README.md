# python-api-challenge
In this activity, I used Python requests and APIs to dig deeper into what the weather is like approaching the equator (beyond just getting hotter). 
This activity is broken down into two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy.
In WeatherPy, I created a Python script to visualize the weather in over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using the citipy Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API.
Next, in VacationPy, I used data gathered from WeatherPy to plan future vacations, then mapped them using geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
